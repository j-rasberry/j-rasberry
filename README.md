# A little about me

I'm a web developer. I enjoy creating solutions out of nothing more than the knowledge in my head and the 1 and 0 that light up my screens.

## Projects I'm current working on.

- Christmas Shuffle


# Current goals

 - I have been wanting to spend more time learning how to use Github for a while now. I want to contribute to 
open source projects and more regularly push code to github.
